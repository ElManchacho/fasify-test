# fasify-test

Just a test project to train fastify API creation

# Ideas

## To come

For now, nothing.

## Done

Tidy route instanciation --> OK

Have a complete CRUD logic delivered by the API (CREATE, READ, UPDATE, DELETE)

--> READ : OK

--> CREATE (POST request)

--> UPDATE

--> DELETE

A route to create an object

A route that'd take headers and body values in account

A basic test swagger (add @fastify/swagger + @fastify/swagger-ui to your fastify server)

# Start things

## Prerequisite

```bash
npm i
```


## Start API server (in main folder)

```bash
node server
```


# Access things

## Endpoint

Find your http adress to call your requests on here : http://localhost:3000/

(a basic hello world is bound to that exact adress)

## Swagger

And the swagger to observe here
